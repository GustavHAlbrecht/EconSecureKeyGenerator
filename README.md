# EconSecureKeyGenerator
Idea: Combine a human-unique identifier like FirstnameLastnameBirthdateBirthplace and a secret 6-8 decimal digit number. Use the resulting bit sequence to generate a private key. The algorithm to do must be computationally intensive and therefore costly (for example using repeated hashing). Suppose Costs of generating a private Key are c. Suppose further the secret number has n decimial digest and therefore the space contains 10^n differnt combinations. Given that an attacker knows the human-unique identifier and assuming secret numbers are uniformly distributed in the space he would have to try (10^n)/2 differnt combinations on average to extract the private key. This would imply cost of (10^n)/2 *c.
